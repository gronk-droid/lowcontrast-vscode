# Pen Paper Coffee :pencil2::scroll::coffee:

*Pen Paper Coffee* is a syntax theme for [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and is specifically designed for writing papers, essays etc. in [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown).
The theme features  several useful, but not distracting syntax highlightings.
The overall colors are inspired by the soft beige paper you would find in a notebook. While the ink (text color) is a dark blue, all quotes and citations are in a warm brownish orange to contrast them better to your own words.

Although the goal of this theme was to have a pleasant markdown writing experience, it looks good with other docs too! I personally use it for much of my coding work (JS, HTML, CSS, c++, python, glsl).


## Original Atom Theme

This this the adaption of my original ["Pen Paper Coffee"](https://github.com/nylki/pen-paper-coffee-syntax) theme for [Atom](https://atom.io/), which I and apparently quite a few other people have used intensely. Since Atom got abandoned in the last few years, I decided to create a new theme for VS Code which became my new go-to editor for most things.
I tried to match the colors of the original theme as closely as possible to maintain the feel of the original theme and also made some adjustments for some syntaxes/languages.

Since VS Code themes allow styling of the overall UI, you can now enjoy an even more coffee-paper-like feel with this theme. :D
